This is the Portfolio Website I built for a school assignment back in Term 1 of my Diploma of Web Development studies.

I was super proud of the effort I put in, and I received a High Distinction for my submission 🤓 <i>\#overacheiver</i>

A year later, it's past time I revisit this and put into practice more of what I learned since that original submission! I know there are definite areas I can improve upon, things I can tighten up and tweak, and I'm excited to make this more of a love project now as I jump into the rest of my coder journey.
