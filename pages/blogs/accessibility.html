            <h2>My Uncomfortable Truth About Accessibility</h2>
            <p class="date">5th April, 2024</p>
        </div>

        <p>'Accessibility'.</p>
        
        <p>Iâ€™ve always associated that word with ramps, handrails, closer parking spots. </p>
        
        <p>Concepts like avoiding fonts with mirrored lettering for people with dyslexia, designing a colour palette with a high white/black contrast score for those with visual impairments, easily navigable pages and features for an audience who might need to use a keyboard over a mouse never really crossed my mind. </p>

        <p>And that's just for websites.</p>

        <p>How many other facets of life have I taken for granted?</p>

        <p>In what other areas have my own health, well being, ease of life kept me in a state of ignorance?</p>

        <p>I cringe thinking about it.</p>

        <p>I like to believe I am empathetic, aware, sensitive. Iâ€™m sure we all do. This revelation, however, makes me feel squeamish, uncomfortable: the fact that Iâ€™ve had such huge blind spots purely due to the privilege I was born with in not having had to live through similar struggles.</p>

        <p>It does present an opportunity, though.</p>

        <p>The scales might have fallen from my eyes on these areas, but where else am I lacking knowledge and understanding? How else can I use my position, my work, my voice to help empower those who <i>do</i> struggle with such things?</p>

        <p>Instead of lingering in shame, I will embrace the open path to journey further, learn more, and intentionally keep growing. I'll also have to update a few things on this website, now that I'm aware I can do better!</p>
        
        <p>Hopefully, my story might also help others learn and grow too. </p>

        <p>As well as making websites more accessible along the way, of course ðŸ˜‰</p>
