            <h2>
                Hello, it's nice to meet you (via my portfolio)! 
            </h2>

            <p>As the header and footer say: I'm Naomi Mowbray, and I've recently joined the ranks of all the web developers and coders who came before me.</p>

            <p>My journey into the world of IT has been a bit of a wild one, and to be honest, compeltely unexpected.</p>

            <p>I've lived many an adventure in my 32 years.</p>

            <p>I joined the Royal Australian Navy at eighteen, and then I was in one of the top performing network marking teams for a pyramid scheme shortly after. There was a period where I taught toddlers how to swim and hosted trivia on Wednesday nights afterward at the local pub. I even had a season working as a council parking inspector - while living in a van to save up for my hike from Mexico to Canada. </p>
            
            <p>And no, I'm not kidding about the parking inspector/vanlife juxtaposition <em>or</em> walking the 4200km trail that took me eight months to complete. </p>
            
            <p>My first exposure to html and very elementary coding was similar to many other millenials: through the personalisation of my Myspace page.</p>
            
            <p>Being able to understand how to change text to <b>bold</b> (which ironically doesn't work with this font but we can pretend!), or <u>underlining</u> it, or how to add 'glitter' to a page when someone first entered (which I'm not gunna do here, don't worry), felt like a major personal success for my 15 year old self.</p>

            <p>As The Facebook became more prevalent, that knowledge of how to tweak front end code became redundant, and it's taken me another seventeen years to revisit those memories and see myself completely dive in with a Diploma of IT in Web Development and Coding - way more than one little Myspace page!</p>

        <div class="right-time">
            <p>And, if all that's not enough, I also like puzzles. That picture above is me and my precious 6000 piece puzzle that I hung onto for EIGHT YEARS until I felt the time was right to give it a crack. 
            </p>
            <p>Well, that 'right time' was the beginning of 2023, which is coincidentally when I began my adventure with Coder Academy into a more useful (and professional) sort of puzzling.</p>
