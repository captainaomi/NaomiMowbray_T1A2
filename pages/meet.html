            <h2>Hello, it's super nice to meet you (via my portfolio)!</h2>

            <p>As the header and footer say: I'm Naomi Mowbray, and I've recently joined the ranks of all the web developers and coders who came before me.</p>

            <p>My journey into the world of IT has been a bit of a wild one, and to be honest, completely unexpected... I've lived many an adventure in my 32 years, and there's more on that below if you want a little read/insight.</p>

            <p>But, for now, I'm guessing you made your way here because you're in the market for a new junior developer, and I'm hoping that's me!</p>

            <p>My first exposure to html and verrrry elementary coding was similar to many other millenials: through the personalisation of my Myspace page.</p>
            
            <p>Being able to understand how to change text to <b>bold</b> or <u>underlining</u> it, or how to add 'glitter' to a page when someone first entered (which I'm not gunna do here, don't worry), felt like a major personal success for my 15 year old self.</p>

            <p>As 'The Facebook' became more prevalent, that knowledge of how to tweak front end code became redundant, and it's taken me another seventeen years to revisit those memories and see myself completely dive in with a Diploma of IT in Web Development and Coding - way more than my original little old Myspace page!</p>

            <h2>I was honoured to be awarded the Diversity Scholarship for my intake with Coder Academy.</h2>

            <p>And with that, I also get the privilege of setting an example to other females who have yet to take the plunge into tech. The gender disparity in the industry, is no secret, but it's also not one that should scare any ladies off.</p>

            <p>Coder Academy was pretty intense, but it left me as a wiz coder across different languages, frameworks, databases and software.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Again, I know you're not necessarily here for my complete autobiography, so here's a snapshot of some of the best/juiciest parts:
            </p>

            <p>I joined the Royal Australian Navy at eighteen, and shortly after completing my Defence Force Gap Year, I was in one of Australia's top performing network marking teams. There was a period where I taught toddlers how to swim and I hosted trivia on Wednesday nights afterward at the local pub. I even had a season working as a council parking inspector - while living in a van to save up so I could hike the Pacific Crest Trail. </p>

            <p>As for seeing the world, I've volunteered in Uganda, Morooco, Belize, and India. I've visited Disneyland in three continents - it really is one of the happiest places on earth! - and I even went to the Paris and California parks by myself just because I love it so much!</p>

            <p>The hardest adventure I've had was hiking the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea, the most blisters I've ever had from hiking was the Camino de Santiago across Spain, and the most life changing and simply best hike EVER was my 4,200km trek from Mexico to Canada.</p>
        
            <p>And, if all that's not enough, my partner and I have adopted two cats, in my 'spare time' I crochet, and I also like puzzles. That picture up above is me with my precious 6000 piece world map puzzle that I had sitting in a closet unopened for EIGHT YEARS until I felt the time was right to give it a crack. That 'right time' was the beginning of 2023, which is coincidentally when I began my adventure with Coder Academy into a more useful (and professional) sort of puzzling.</p>
   
            <p>Like I said, it's super nice to meet you. </p>

            <p>I look forward to doing it in person one day!</p>

            <h2>PS. Nope, I wasn't kidding about the parking inspector/vanlife juxtaposition <em>or</em> walking the 4,200km Pacific Crest Trail that took me eight months to complete. </h2>
